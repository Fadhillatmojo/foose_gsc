# FOOSE by Mosaic Minds
Built with Flutter, Firebase, and GCP

Mosaic Minds addresses the challenge of (SDG 12) in Indonesia, a notable contributor to global food waste. Rooted in a lack of awareness about consumption and post-consumption management, common scenario like forgotten items in the fridge that led to more problems highlight the urgent need for change. 

We approach consumer behavior as an opportunity to develop our solution, a mobile-app that features a robust food stocks tracking component, educates users on sustainable food management, and promotes a zero-waste lifestyle. 

We target home cooks, housewives, and those aged 25 and above as our primary and secondary markets. With a commitment to SDG 12, our solution aims to significantly reduce household food waste, fostering a community of conscious consumers and reshaping the narrative around sustainable living.
